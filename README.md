Zed A Shaw learn python the hard way using Python 3

As Zed A Shaw explicitly tells in his book "Learn Python the Hard Way" to use python 2.7 not 3.4 or even 3.6.
I am doing his book using Python 3.6 out of curiousity.

On 18 July 2017 I just found out that Mr Zed A Shaw did not make his learnpythonthehardway as freely public. Will need to saving up money to buy and finish this.
